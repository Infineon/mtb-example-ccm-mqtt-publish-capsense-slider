# AIROC™ CCM MQTT-PUBLISH-CAPSENSE-SLIDER

This code example demonstrates publishing MQTT messages to AWS IoT Core with the help of Cloud Connectivity Manager (CCM) evaluation kit. This code example features a 5-segment CAPSENSE™ slider. The brightness of the LED is calculated based on the position in linear slider and the brightness is published to the topic "MySubTopic" in AWS IoT core.

The CCM module is a configurable Wi-Fi connectivity module that provides a simple, secure, plug-and-play solution for connecting products to AWS IoT cloud services. The CCM module is preprogrammed with a tested secured firmware and supports an easy-to-use AT command interface for configuration.

The preprogrammed firmware supports AWS IoT ExpressLink specification. For more details, see the [AWS IoT ExpressLink programmer's guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-expresslink/latest/programmersguide/elpg.html).

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

**Note:**
Choose "implicit CR in every LF" and "implicit LF in every CR" in PuTTY Terminal Configuration.


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Project_Creator_Guide_3-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99bcabbd31e5&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Library_Manager_User_Guide_3-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99ab34b831ce&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-Eclipse_IDE_for_ModusToolbox_User_Guide_1-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99bcb86331e8&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[mtb-example-ccm-mqtt-publish-capsense-slider](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ccm-mqtt-publish-capsense-slider)" application with the desired name "CcmMqttPublishCapsenseSlider" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062-4343W* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --app-id mtb-example-ccm-mqtt-publish-capsense-slider --user-app-name CcmMqttPublishCapsenseSlider --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_2.4_User_Guide-Software-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7e7124d1017ed97e72563632&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation


If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (such as CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-software) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

Two types of flow can be followed in this code example.

1. AWS flow 
2. Infineon CIRRENT&trade; cloud flow

To know more details about the two flows, see the [AN234322 - Getting started with AIROC&trade; IFW56810 Single-band Wi-Fi 4 Cloud Connectivity Manager](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-AN234322_-_Getting_Started_with_AIROC_IFW56810_Single-band_Wi-Fi_4_Cloud_Connectivity_Manager-ApplicationNotes-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7e7124d1017e90db764f0c6b&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-application_note).

<b>AWS flow</b>

**Note:** See section 6.1.2 AWS flow in the [AN234322 - Getting started with AIROC&trade; IFW56810 Single-band Wi-Fi 4 Cloud Connectivity Manager](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-AN234322_-_Getting_Started_with_AIROC_IFW56810_Single-band_Wi-Fi_4_Cloud_Connectivity_Manager-ApplicationNotes-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7e7124d1017e90db764f0c6b&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-application_note) for creating a "Thing" in AWS console using the output you receive from the terminal.

**Note:**

- Send the **AT+FACTORY_RESET** command to the CCM device before changing from one flow to another flow.
- Similarly, send the **AT+RESET** command to the CCM device while changing from one endpoint to another.
- While porting to non PSoC&trade; microcontrollers, change UART TX/RX API's and bsp specific API's present in the *CCM.c* file to your microcontroller specific APIs.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-Eclipse_IDE_for_ModusToolbox_User_Guide_1-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99bcb86331e8&utm_source=cypress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=202110_globe_en_all_integration-files).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/PSoC-6-MCU-Code-in-main-executes-before-the-debugger-halts-at-the-first-line-of/ta-p/253856) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

In this project, PSoC™ 6 MCU scans a self-capacitance (CSD) based 5-element CAPSENSE™ slider. The project uses the CAPSENSE™ Middleware (see ModusToolbox™ user guide for more details on selecting a middleware).

See AN85951 – PSoC™ 4 and PSoC™ 6 MCU CAPSENSE™ design guide for more details on CAPSENSE™ features and usage.

In this application, the state of the user LED is controlled based on user inputs provided using the CAPSENSE™ slider. A PWM HAL resource is configured for controlling the brightness of the LED. The brightness of the LED is set based on the touch position on the CAPSENSE™ slider. The current brightness of the LED is sent to CCM module via AT-COMMANDS using UART (HAL) resource and the CCM module publishes the brightness data to AWS_IOT core.

The ModusToolbox™ CAPSENSE™ configurator tool guide describes step-by-step instructions on how to configure CAPSENSE™ in the application. The CAPSENSE™ configurator and tuner tools can be launched from the CSD personality in the device configurator tool.

The application uses an EZI2C HAL interface for communicating with the CAPSENSE™ tuner.
